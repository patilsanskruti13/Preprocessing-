📊 # Data Preprocessing Repository
📌 # Overview
This repository contains data preprocessing performed on three different datasets: Student, Employee, and General Dataset (Data1). The goal is to clean, transform, and prepare raw data for machine learning and data analysis tasks.

📂 # Datasets Used
Student Dataset – Contains student-related information with missing and duplicate values
Employee Dataset – Includes employee records with null values and inconsistencies
Data1 Dataset – A general dataset used to practice preprocessing techniques
All datasets are provided in CSV format.

🔧 # Preprocessing Steps Performed
Handling missing (null) values
Removing duplicate records
Encoding categorical variables
Feature scaling (if required)
Renaming columns for consistency
Data type correction
Basic data exploration

🛠️ # Tools & Libraries Used
Python
Pandas
NumPy
Scikit-learn
